<h2>QFTP version 0.98 by Peter Strand (pst@2.sbbs.se)</h2>

<p>
This program is under development, this means that the most unexpected things
can happen when you least expect it...  I'm currently doing a total rewrite of
the former qftp-0.92 in C++. 0.92 was a collection of quick-and-dirty hacks and
segfaulted a bit too often.  This new version doesn't have all the features of
0.92 yet but I'm working on it. But it's more stable and the source is cleaner,
and I'm putting in more features and fixing bugs (and introducing new
interesting ones) when I've got time and this will hopefully be a useful program
one day :) In the meantime would I be very happy if you could send me bug
reports and describe what happend and under which circumstances (I know that the
program can crash, but I have to know when it crashes to be able to do something
about it). My email-address is <a href="mailto:pst@2.sbbs.se">pst@2.sbbs.se</a>
<p>

The idea behind the program is to make it fast and efficient to use, 
no unneccessary keypresses and time saving features. 
I have many more ideas for thish which I haven't coded yet (see the TODO file
for some), so watch out for new versions!
If you have a neat idea please let me know and I'll try to include it.

<p>
I've developed this under Linux but it should work under most unixes, 
if you have problem then let me know and I'll see what I can do about it.
It also works (sort of) under windows (95 or NT) with the cygnus gcc port, 
which you can get at www.cygnus.com/gnu-win32/
<p>
I have finally written a manual page!
<br>Apart from that can you use the ? command to view available commands and
options in the program. And you can of course read the source :)<br>
The source is the most reliable documentation, the man page is sometimes a bit
out of sync... :)
